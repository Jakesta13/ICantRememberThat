# ICantRememberThat
These scripts are basically a colletion of scripts that set up commands that I usually cannot remember how to do, and resort to
just searcing ~/.bash_history for it each time.

~There may also be some scripts that are just plain lazy.~

It's good pratice to look at the code for each script that you plan on using, it may not work for your system.

## Scripts list
* [Mcworld.sh](Minecraft/Mcworld.sh) - Lets you download your minecraft world over SSH Tarball, instead of saving a backup on the host machine.
